        <p style="color: orange; background-color: black;"><strong>Jumbo's Pizza</strong> is an authentic <em>New York</em> style 
        pizza place brought to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Owner and operator Big Al grew up in 
        New York City and spent 35 years learning under world famous Sal Marcano.
        It starts off with fresh never frozen ingredients and dough to bring his 
        creations to perfection. It uses a wood fired brick oven to cook it to the right
        tempature so the cheese still drips off as you lift each slice.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p style="color: orange; background-color: black;">New York style pizza is both thin and crispy not overwhelmed by sauce and
        toppings. One of the hallmarks of this style is the very large pieces that 
        are eaten by folding it in half to keep the cheese from falling off the sides.
        </p>
